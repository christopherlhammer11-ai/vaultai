## Full Description (4000 chars max — Google Play)

HammerLock AI is a privacy-first AI assistant that keeps your conversations encrypted and under your control. Unlike other AI apps, HammerLock uses local-first architecture — your data stays on your device, encrypted with AES-256-GCM before it ever touches the cloud.

**Why HammerLock AI?**

- Military-grade encryption: All conversations are encrypted with AES-256-GCM using PBKDF2 key derivation (100,000 iterations). Your vault key never leaves your device.
- Multiple AI models: Access GPT-4o, Claude, Gemini, Groq, Mistral, and more through a single interface. HammerLock automatically routes to the fastest available provider.
- Local-first design: Your conversation history is stored encrypted on-device. No cloud sync means no data exposure.
- Open source core: Built on OpenClaw, our open-source AI agent framework. Audit the code yourself at github.com/hammerlockai.

**Features:**

- Chat with advanced AI models (GPT-4o, Claude 3.5, Gemini Pro, Llama 3)
- Vault-encrypted conversation storage
- Biometric unlock (Face ID / fingerprint)
- Dark mode interface
- Streaming responses — see answers as they're generated
- Web search integration for real-time information
- Code assistance with syntax highlighting
- Multiple AI personas (General, Code, Creative, Research)
- Credit-based usage with transparent pricing
- No ads, no tracking, no data selling

**Privacy First:**

HammerLock AI is built by developers who believe AI should be powerful AND private. We don't store your prompts on our servers. We don't train on your data. We don't sell your information. Period.

Your conversations are encrypted locally with a key derived from your passphrase. Even if someone gained access to your device storage, they couldn't read your chats without your passphrase.

**Pricing:**

- Free tier: 50 credits/month
- Pro: $12/month — 2,000 credits, priority routing
- Ultra: $25/month — 5,000 credits, all models, priority support
- Enterprise: Custom pricing for teams

Cancel anytime. No long-term contracts.
